            <p style="font-size: x-large;">Mothra (モスラ Mosura?), also dubbed Titanus Mosura, is the tritagonist of the MonsterVerse franchise.

                She is a lepidopteran-like kaiju known as Titanus Mosura who is capable of defending the natural world and was revered as a goddess by ancient human civilizations. Mothra also serves as Godzilla's trusted ally as she aided him in battle against his nemesis Ghidorah.
                Mothra is given her name due to the fact she resembles a gigantic moth. The name "Titanus Mosura" comes from the Latin term "Titanus", meaning Titan, with "Mosura" being a Japanese translation of Mothra. The novelization of the film reveals that "Mosura" is the name that is given to her by the natives of a small Indonesian island that worship her, and that the name itself means "giver of life".
                Mothra's egg was fleshy rather than hard, and appeared to be coated in vine-like structures which fell away during Mothra's birth (whether these were a part of the egg or due to Mothra's life-attracting influence is unknown). When metamorphosing, her chrysalis (from what little was seen of it through the waterfall) appeared to resemble a gigantic version of a moth chrysalis with a long and slender shape, producing bright and flashing bioluminescent lights which highlighted blue- and yellow-seeming segments.

                Her larval form is much more insectoid in appearance compared to other incarnations; possessing a vaguely armadillo-like segmented back, double-jointed and somewhat caterpillar-like legs, and three arthropod-like mandibles and teeth, as opposed to past incarnations which only possessed two mandibles. Her back-segments can shift and vibrate slightly with her emotion when she's aggravated. Her head is somewhat round with beady, surprisingly vertebrate-like blue eyes. She prominently produces a bioluminescent glow from under her skin - this glow is normally colored bright-blue, but she changes color to red when provoked to aggression.

                Appearance

                a hair-lined body consisting of numerous colors, feathery antennae ('varied-antennae'), and four large wings which sweep or drag behind her body when they're not extended. Her wings are patterned with black, orange, yellow and blue colors and possess prominent eye patterns (akin to her Showa, Heisei and Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. designs). When her wings are bioluminescent, they glow with a series of brilliant colors. Her wings are also much longer and narrower in proportion to the rest of her body than in most incarnations.

Her main body's hair is white and brown, and her head is stockier than most incarnations. She retains a facial resemblance to her larval form in the form of her mandibles, whilst her blue eyes are now larger and slanted, making them appear vaguely more insectoid. She possesses an abdomen shaped like a wasp's (much like her 2001 incarnation) with a large, retractable stinger. She possesses three pairs of insectoid legs - a double-jointed front and middle pair (the latter pair are often kept tucked between and under the former) which she uses as blade-like offensive weapons, and a triple-jointed pair of hind legs.
